 The major differences between Phase II and Phase III are primarily in the backend functionality and AI integration, while the frontend appearance remains largely
    the same. Here are the key differences:

    Backend & Functional Differences:

    Phase II:
     - Basic task management (CRUD operations)
     - Simple authentication system
     - Standard REST API endpoints
     - Basic database models for tasks and users

    Phase III:
     - Advanced AI Integration: Natural language processing that allows users to interact with the system using conversational language
     - MCP Tools: Sophisticated tool integration that allows the AI to perform operations like add_task, list_tasks, update_task, delete_task, complete_task based on
       natural language input
     - Conversation History: Full conversation tracking with AI interactions stored in the database
     - Enhanced AI Service: Integration with OpenAI-compatible APIs for semantic understanding of user requests
     - Smart Parsing: The system can interpret phrases like "add a task to buy groceries" and automatically call the appropriate backend functions
     - Richer Data Models: Additional models for conversations, chat messages, and AI interactions

    Frontend Appearance:
     - The visual design remains largely the same (same UI components, layout, styling)
     - The main addition is the chat interface which allows natural language interaction
     - Existing task management UI is still present alongside the new chat functionality
     - The website's look and feel remains consistent with the previous phase

    Key Enhancement:
    The biggest difference is how users interact with the system:
     - Phase II: Users had to use specific UI controls to manage tasks
     - Phase III: Users can now type natural language like "add a task to call mom tomorrow" or "show my incomplete tasks" and the AI understands and executes the
       appropriate backend functions

    So while the website visually looks similar, Phase III adds a powerful AI layer that transforms how users interact with the system, making it much more intuitive
    and conversational.
